# OpenVTC Config Data Structure

The OpenVTC tool stores configuration data in three main categories:

1. **Public Config** - Contains publicly shareable configuration and
   metadata.
2. **Secured Config** - Contains BIP32 seed, cryptographic keys and
   key derivation information.
3. **Protected Config** - Contains private data like contacts,
   relationships, tasks, and VRCs.

## Protection Modes

The tool supports three protection modes for securing data:

- **Encrypted** - Protects the `SecuredConfig` with an unlock
  code/passphrase.
- **Plaintext** - Stores `SecuredConfig` in plaintext without
  encryption (not recommended for production use).
- **Token** - Protects `SecuredConfig` with an encrypted session
  key (ESK) using a hardware token (e.g., OpenPGP card).

See the
[Handling Secured Configuration](./secured-configuration-management.md)
documentation for more details.

## Config Storage Mapping

The OpenVTC tool manages configuration data across three storage types:

| Storage Type        | Content                                                                   | Storage Location                                         | Encryption                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **PublicConfig**    | Metadata, DIDs, friendly names, logs, reference to encrypted private data | `~/.config/openvtc/config.json` (or `config-{profile}.json`) | Private field only                     |
| **SecuredConfig**   | BIP32 seed, key derivation info, cryptographic materials                  | OS secure storage (keyring/keychain)                     | Based on protection mode               |
| **ProtectedConfig** | Contacts, relationships, tasks, VRCs                                      | Encrypted inside `PublicConfig.private` field            | Always encrypted with `m/1'/0'/0'` key |

**Loading Configuration:**

When calling the OpenVTC tool commands, it loads the three
configurations and combines them into a single `Config` struct that
the application uses to complete a request.

When saving the configuration:

1. **PublicConfig** is serialized to JSON and saved to disk.
2. **SecuredConfig** is saved to the OS secure storage. It is
   encrypted depending on the selected protection mode.
3. **ProtectedConfig** is encrypted with the key derived from
   `m/1'/0'/0'` path and stored in the `private` field of
   `PublicConfig`.

See
[Profiles and Configurations](../README.md#profiles-and-configurations)
for configuration file locations and environment variables.

## Data Flow and Workflows

### Relationship Establishment Workflow

The relationship establishment process involves multiple state transitions,
which are tracked in both relationships and tasks. The workflow differs
depending on whether you are initiating (Requestor) or receiving (Recipient)
the relationship request.

#### Requestor Side (Outbound Request)

The party initiating the relationship request goes through these states:

| Step | Action                    | Relationship State | Task Type                                          | Description                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Send relationship request | `RequestSent`      | `RelationshipRequestOutbound { to: "remote_did" }` | Initial request is sent to the remote party. A task is created to track the outbound request. |
| 2    | Receive acceptance        | `RequestSent`      | `RelationshipRequestAccepted`                      | Remote party accepts the request. A new task is fetched indicating acceptance.                |
| 3    | Finalize relationship     | `Established`      | `RelationshipRequestFinalized`                     | Relationship is confirmed and fully established. Task indicates finalization.                 |

**State Transitions:**

- `RequestSent` → `Established` (when acceptance is received and finalized)

#### Recipient Side (Inbound Request)

The party receiving the relationship request goes through these states:

| Step | Action                       | Relationship State    | Task Type                      | Description                                                                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Receive relationship request | N/A (not yet created) | `RelationshipRequestInbound`   | Incoming request is received. A task is created for user to review and act upon.          |
| 2    | Accept request               | `RequestAccepted`     | N/A                            | User accepts the request. Relationship is created with `RequestAccepted` state.           |
| 3    | Relationship established     | `Established`         | `RelationshipRequestFinalized` | Requestor finalizes, relationship becomes fully established. Task indicates finalization. |

**State Transitions:**

- No relationship → `RequestAccepted` (when user accepts inbound request)
- `RequestAccepted` → `Established` (when requestor finalizes)

#### Relationship Workflow Sequence

The end-to-end workflow to establish a relationship between two personas:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant REQ as Requestor
    participant REC as Recipient

    Note over REQ: State: None
    Note over REC: State: None

    REQ->>REQ: Create Relationship<br/>State: RequestSent<br/>Task: RelationshipRequestOutbound
    REQ->>+REC: Send Relationship Request

    Note over REC: Task: RelationshipRequestInbound
    REC->>REC: User Reviews Request
    REC->>REC: Accept Request<br/>State: RequestAccepted
    REC-->>-REQ: Send Acceptance Message

    Note over REQ: Task: RelationshipRequestAccepted
    REQ->>REQ: Finalize Relationship<br/>State: Established<br/>Task: RelationshipRequestFinalized
    REQ->>+REC: Send Finalization

    Note over REC: State: Established<br/>Task: RelationshipRequestFinalized
    REC-->>-REQ: Acknowledge

    Note over REQ,REC: Relationship Fully Established
```

#### Relationship Workflow Key Points

- **Asynchronous Process**: The workflow involves message exchanges
  that may not be instantaneous.
- **Task-Driven**: Each state change is accompanied by task
  creation/updates that drive user interactions.
- **Bi-directional Communication**: Both parties must confirm the
  relationship for it to reach `Established` state.
- **Log Tracking**: Each significant action generates log entries
  for audit purposes.

See the
[Establishing Relationship](./relationships-vrcs.md#establish-relationship)
documentation for more details.

### VRC Request and Issuance Workflow

The VRC (Verifiable Relationship Credential) request and issuance
process involves interaction between two personas: a credential
requester (subject) and a credential issuer.

The workflow is tracked through tasks and stored VRCs.

#### Requester Side (VRC Request)

The persona requesting a verifiable relationship credential goes through
the following steps:

| Step | Action                  | VRC Storage     | Task Type            | Description                                                                                                |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Request VRC from issuer | N/A             | `VrcRequestOutbound` | Requester sends a credential request to the issuer. Task tracks the outbound request.                      |
| 2    | Receive VRC             | `vrcs_received` | `VrcReceived`        | Issuer issues the credential. The VRC is verified and stored in `vrcs_received`. A task indicates receipt. |
| 3    | Verify and store VRC    | `vrcs_received` | N/A                  | The VRC is verified and stored for future use.                                                             |

#### Issuer Side (VRC Issuance)

The persona issuing a verifiable relationship credential goes through
the following steps:

| Step | Action                | VRC Storage   | Task Type           | Description                                                                        |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Receive VRC request   | N/A           | `VrcRequestInbound` | Incoming credential request is received. A task is created for the user to review. |
| 2    | Issue VRC             | `vrcs_issued` | N/A                 | User approves and issues the credential. The VRC is stored in `vrcs_issued`.       |
| 3    | Send VRC to requester | `vrcs_issued` | N/A                 | The issued VRC is sent to the requester.                                           |

#### VRC Workflow Sequence

The end-to-end workflow for VRC request and issuance:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Requester as VRC Requester<br/>(Subject)
    participant Issuer as VRC Issuer

    Note over Requester: vrcs_received: empty
    Note over Issuer: vrcs_issued: empty

    Requester->>Requester: Create VRC Request<br/>Task: VrcRequestOutbound
    Requester->>+Issuer: Send VRC Request

    Note over Issuer: Task: VrcRequestInbound
    Issuer->>Issuer: User Reviews Request
    Issuer->>Issuer: Create & Sign VRC<br/>Store in vrcs_issued
    Issuer-->>-Requester: Send VRC

    Note over Requester: Task: VrcReceived
    Requester->>Requester: Verify VRC Signature
    Requester->>Requester: Store in vrcs_received

    Note over Requester,Issuer: VRC Issuance Complete

    rect rgb(200, 220, 250)
    Note over Requester: VRC Stored in vrcs_received<br/>Can be used for verification
    Note over Issuer: VRC Stored in vrcs_issued<br/>Can be used for verification
    end
```

#### VRC Workflow Key Points

- **Separate Storage**: Issued and received VRCs are stored separately
  (`vrcs_issued` vs `vrcs_received`).
- **Cryptographic Verification**: VRCs are cryptographically signed by the
  issuer and verified by the recipient.
- **Expiration Tracking**: VRCs can have optional expiration times for
  time-limited credentials.
- **Task-Driven**: Both request and receipt are tracked through tasks
  requiring user interaction.
- **Audit Trail**: Key VRC events are logged for audit purposes.

See the [Requesting Verifiable Relationship Credential](./relationships-vrcs.md#request-verifiable-relationship-credential-vrc)
documentation for more details.

## Logs Structure

Logs track key events in the OpenVTC tool from initial setup to establishing
relationships and receiving VRCs. New messages are appended, and old messages
are retained up to the configured limit.

**Logs Structure:**

| Field      | Type                   | Description                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `messages` | `VecDeque<LogMessage>` | Double-ended queue of log messages.        |
| `limit`    | `usize`                | Maximum number of log entries (e.g., 100). |

**LogMessage Structure:**

| Field     | Type            | Description                                                                   |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `created` | `DateTime<Utc>` | Timestamp when the log entry was created (e.g., 2026-01-12T05:45:19.989808Z). |
| `type_`   | `LogFamily`     | Type of log event (Config, Contact, Relationship, Task).                      |
| `message` | `String`        | Log message content.                                                          |

**Log Types (`LogFamily`):**

| Type           | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Config`       | Configuration-related events.  |
| `Contact`      | Contact management events.     |
| `Relationship` | Relationship lifecycle events. |
| `Task`         | Task creation and updates.     |

**Log Examples:**

- **Config**: "Initial openvtc setup completed"
- **Contact**: "Added contact (did:webvh:...openvtc) alias(John Doe)"
- **Relationship**: "Relationship requested: remote
  DID(did:webvh:...openvtc) Task ID(5be058b3-...)"
- **Task**: "Fetched: Task ID(5be058b3-...) Type(Relationship
  Request (Inbound)) From(did:webvh:...openvtc)"

From a complete relationship establishment:

```rust
logs: Logs {
    messages: [
        // Initial setup
        LogMessage {
            created: 2026-01-12T05:45:19.989808Z,
            type_: Config,
            message: "Initial openvtc setup completed",
        },
        // Contact added
        LogMessage {
            created: 2026-01-12T06:05:00.345729Z,
            type_: Contact,
            message: "Added contact (did:webvh:...openvtc) alias(John Doe)",
        },
        // Relationship requested
        LogMessage {
            created: 2026-01-12T06:05:00.361997Z,
            type_: Relationship,
            message: "Relationship requested: remote DID(...openvtc) Task ID(5be058b3-...)",
        },
        // Request finalized
        LogMessage {
            created: 2026-01-12T06:06:08.646416Z,
            type_: Relationship,
            message: "Relationship request finalized: remote DID(...openvtc) Task ID(5be058b3-...)",
        },
        // Task fetched
        LogMessage {
            created: 2026-01-12T06:06:08.646429Z,
            type_: Task,
            message: "Fetched: Task ID(5be058b3-...)
                Type(Relationship Request Accepted) From(...openvtc)",
        },
    ],
    limit: 100,
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **BIP32 Seed**: The BIP32 seed is the master secret from which all keys
   are derived. It must be protected and stored in a secure place that only
   you have access to.

2. **Protected Config Encryption**: The `private` field in `PublicConfig`
   contains an encrypted reference to the `ProtectedConfig` data. Regardless
   of the protection method selected, `ProtectedConfig` is always encrypted
   with the key derived from the `m/1'/0'/0'` path.

## Thread Safety

The OpenVTC tool uses `Mutex<T>` wrappers for mutable shared data, such as
Relationships and Tasks. This ensures data is protected during concurrent
operations or interactions with the OpenVTC tool.

The `poisoned` flag indicates whether a Mutex panicked while locked.
In normal operation, this should always be `false`.

## State Consistency

The OpenVTC tool maintains consistency between related data structures, for example:

- When a relationship is created, corresponding tasks are created.
- When a contact is added, logs are updated.
- Relationship states align with task states throughout the workflow.
